## What is OpenAEV EE?

OpenAEV Enterprise Edition is based on the open core concept. This means that the source code of OBAS EE remains open
source and included in the main GitHub repository of the platform but is published under a specific license. As
specified in the GitHub license file:

- The OpenAEV Community Edition is licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the “Apache License”).
- The OpenAEV Enterprise Edition is licensed under the OpenAEV Enterprise Edition License (the “Enterprise Edition
  License”).

The source files in this repository have a header indicating which license they are under. If no such header is
provided, this means that the file belongs to the Community Edition under the Apache License, Version 2.0.

## EE Activation

Enterprise edition is easy to activate. You need to go the platform settings and click on the "Manage your Enterprise
Edition License" button.
